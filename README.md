Our mission with SeamlessGrade is to revolutionize education by transforming how student grades are accessed and managed. This groundbreaking project aims to provide seamless access to academic records for 8th to 12th-grade students while equipping educators with efficient tools for grade administration. By enhancing transparency, accessibility, and accountability in education, SeamlessGrade addresses the pressing need within the education sector for a more streamlined and transparent system for managing student grades. It emerged in response to the challenges students and educators face in navigating disparate grade systems across schools and districts and the inefficiencies inherent in traditional grade management processes.
